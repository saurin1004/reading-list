# Reading List

Inspired by [David Ragone reading_list](https://github.com/DavidRagone/reading_list) and [cory schires reading-list](https://github.com/coryschires/reading-list "coryschires's reading-list") (which were in themself inspired by Apprenticeship Patterns).

The goals of this list are:

* Maintain an active record of books I've read, partially read, and plan to read.
* Summarize key takeaways and lessons from each book to reinforce my understanding and serve as a brief review.
* Centralize any blog posts that expand on my thoughts about specific books.
* Offer a publicly accessible repository for notes on select books I've read.
