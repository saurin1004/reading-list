# Reading List

Inspired by [David Ragone reading_list](https://github.com/DavidRagone/reading_list) and [cory schires reading-list](https://github.com/coryschires/reading-list "coryschires's reading-list") (which were in themself inspired by Apprenticeship Patterns).

The goals of this list are:

* Maintain an active record of books I've read, partially read, and plan to read.
* Summarize key takeaways and lessons from each book to reinforce my understanding and serve as a brief review.
* Centralize any blog posts that expand on my thoughts about specific books.
* Offer a publicly accessible repository for notes on select books I've read.



## Books I've Read

## 1. Good to Great

### by Jim Collins

#### Abbreviations:
> G2G - Good to Great

#### CHAPTER 1 - GOOD IS THE ENEMY OF GREAT
**Observations of study:**
- 10/11 great leaders come from within the organization
- Compensation strength unrelated to performance
- Strategy not a factor in G2G (both spend good time on strategies)
- What to do += What not to do + What to stop doing
- Tech. does not drive/ignite G2G transformation
- Merger does not ignite G2G transformation
- Less/Barely attention to change/motivate - under right cond. problems like commitment and motivation melt away
- Revolutionary results without revolutionary process
- G2G unrelated to industry/circumstance. Largely conscious choice

**Overview of framework: Disciplined people, Disciplined thought, Disciplined action**

- Level 5 Leadership: Low profile, self effacing, quite, reserved, shy, humility + professional will = G2G leader
- First Who: Right people are most important assets
- Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith): Stockdate Paradox - maintain unwavering faith that I can and will prevail in the end irrespective of difficulty, AND have discipline to face most brutal facts of current reality
- The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity withing the Three Circles): G2G requires one to trancende curse of competence. If I cannot be best at my core business, then my core business absolutely cannot be basis of a great company - hence needs to be replaced
- A Culture of Discipline: Culture of Discipline + Ethic of entrepreneurship = Great Performance
- Technologu Accelerators: Tech never primary ignition - yet pioneer of application of carefully selected techs
- The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: G2G process - relentlessly pushing a GIANT heavy flywheel in 1 direction until breakthrough
- From G2G to Built to Last: G2G concepts -> Sustained Great Results + Built to Last Concepts -> Enduring Great Company
